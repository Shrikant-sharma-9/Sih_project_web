    Act as an expert hydrogeologist and civil engineer specializing in rainwater harvesting.
    Analyze the following data to determine the feasibility of Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting (RTRWH) and artificial recharge.

    User Data:
    - Location: ${location}
    - Number of Dwellers: ${dwellers}
    - Roof Area: ${roofArea} sq. meters
    - Available Open Space for recharge structures: ${openSpace} sq. meters
    - Predominant Soil Type: ${soilType}

    Based on this data, provide a detailed analysis. Your response MUST be a JSON object that conforms to the provided schema.
    
    Analysis to perform:
    1.  **Feasibility Check**: Based on roof area, rainfall (infer for the location), available open space, and the provided soil type (e.g., sandy soils are better for infiltration than clay soils).
    2.  **Suggested Structure**: Recommend a suitable RTRWH or Artificial Recharge structure (e.g., Recharge Pit, Trench, Shaft, or simple Storage Tank). Your recommendation should be heavily influenced by the provided soil type and available open space. For example, a recharge pit is excellent for sandy soil, while a trench might be better for loam. Clay soils might favor a storage tank over direct recharge.
    3.  **Principal Aquifer**: Identify the likely principal aquifer system for the given location.
    4.  **Groundwater Depth**: Estimate the depth to the groundwater level.
    5.  **Local Rainfall**: Provide an estimated average annual rainfall for the location.
    6.  **Runoff Generation**: Calculate the potential annual runoff. Use a runoff coefficient of 0.85 for a typical roof. Formula: Runoff (Liters) = Roof Area (mÂ²) * Annual Rainfall (mm) * 0.85.
    7.  **Structure Dimensions**: Recommend practical dimensions (length, width, depth in meters) for the suggested recharge structure. The dimensions should be reasonable for the available open space.
    8.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Provide a rough cost estimate for the structure in the local currency (or USD if local is unknown) and a brief cost-benefit analysis, highlighting potential water savings and long-term value.
